# Automated-portfolio-deployment
Public version of the repo which holds my project notes information, used to display the portfolio updating actions workflow

the script works by pulling markdown documents tagged as presentable in the frontmatter, and then puts the presentation sections of the md files into a README template
examples of this script working present on my profile README and portfolio page
